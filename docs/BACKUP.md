## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Objectives
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 1 hour
- Service Level Agreement (SLA): 99.9%
- Data loss tolerance: Near-zero
- System availability: High
- Performance impact: Minimal
- Cost considerations: Moderate
- Compliance requirements: Full

### Recovery Scenarios

#### Complete Service Outage
1. Activate incident response team
2. Assess outage scope and impact
3. Switch to backup region
4. Restore from latest backup
5. Verify data integrity
6. Test system functionality
7. Update DNS records
8. Resume normal operations

#### Data Corruption
1. Identify corruption scope
2. Stop affected services
3. Restore from clean backup
4. Verify data integrity
5. Update affected records
6. Test system functionality
7. Resume operations
8. Post-incident analysis

#### Security Breach
1. Activate security team
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Assess breach scope
4. Restore from pre-breach backup
5. Apply security patches
6. Update credentials
7. Verify system security
8. Resume operations
